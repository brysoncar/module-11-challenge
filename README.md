This is the module-11-challenge for bootcamp class. 

The goal of these exercises was to scrape two websites with Beautiful Soup.

The firest website was: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
I saved the text of the page to a file, and used a for loop to find the article titles and previews for each article. 
I received a lot of help to finish this step, from coworkers, TA's and from chatgpt. I find it much easier to run a for loop on the html rather than a text file generated from the html. 

The second step was to scrape the following website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html, which was in table form, convert the data into a pandasdfataframe and analyze the dataframe. This was straightforward, I did receive some help from a cowroker on adding the headers with code when I created the pandas dataframe, the rest of the code written was from the bootcamp lessons or pandas memory.
